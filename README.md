# testhdm_SF

Hello my name is Stephanie,
Thank you for sending me this test it was really challenging i have learn a lot of new things. Particularly i work more with Node js and express js and a bit of nest js. 
During this test i manage to set up Docker, mysql and connect the database. i was able to change files on the frontend to be able to run the application also run the backend.
i fill up the functions that was empty in some files. i was not able to debug the frontend but i have added  some data to the database and update prisma. i think with much time i will be able to make the application run properly
